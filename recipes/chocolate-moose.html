        <p> A fun filled way to pass the time and create a lovely sweet and savory dish! (Thanks Lenny for posing for the photo above!).</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 Fully Grown Moose.</li>
            <li>40kg of your Chocolate of choice (Avoid any Chocolate with any extras inside such as nuts as this will hinder the coverage when used later on).</li>
            <li>10 Cans of Whipped Cream.</li>
            <li>A Berry of your choice - I'd reccomend a Cherry, but others work just as well!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Equipment Needed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 Meters of Rope.</li>
            <li>A Very large pot to melt the chocolate inside of (Think larger than an average bathtub)</li>
            <li>An industrial Grade Refridgerating Unit (The type Butchers would use).</li>
            <li>A Very large serving Platter.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Travel to Canada or Alaska to Capture an Adult Moose or get your local delivery company to locate and send it to you.</li>
            <li>Collect all your chocolate in your very large pot and completely melt it all - to save time do this while the Moose is in Transit.</li>
            <li>Once the Moose has arrived tie the Moose up with your rope.</li>
            <li>Coat the Moose in your melted Chocolate then set aside in Refrigerating Unit attop your Serving Platter for a Week to properly let the Moose Set.</li>
            <li>Remove the Rope from the Moose then cover non-chocolate covered parts where the rope was with Whipped Cream, then cover the top of the Moose with the remaining Whipped Cream.</li>
            <li>Place the Berry of your choice ontop of the Moose's head.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the dish alone or with friends!</li>

        </ol>
